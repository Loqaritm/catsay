# catsay
Cowsay-inspired little CLI thing for people that like cows, but like cats more.

# Usage
This repository contains a file compiled to run under linux. If you want to run this anywhere else, just compile the source.
Compiled output works by itself, but if you want the jokes to work, the catsay_jokes.csv needs to be in the same folder as the executable.

# Commands and examples

Catsay can be used in the same way as cowsay:

```
./catsay [something to say]
```

</p>

Additionally, catsay can be used to tell jokes! (actually truly bad ones)
```
./catsay joke
```

and serve as an 8ball!
```
./catsay 8ball
```

or, if you want an 8ball that will always have your back:
```
./catsay magic8ball
```
